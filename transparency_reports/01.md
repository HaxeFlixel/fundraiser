##Some protocol on fees:

* These fees are subtracted from the total money pool available to pay to Alexander:
  * IndieGoGo fees subtracted from the total pledged amount
  * Initial Paypal fees taken just to send the money to Level Up Labs' paypal account from IndieGoGo
  * (Basically, the money we have to pay Alex with has these fees taken out before we even get to SEE the money)
* These fees are NOT subtracted from said money pool, and are directly covered by Level Up Labs instead:
  * Paypal transfer fees to send money from Level Up Labs' paypal account to Alexander's
